# Coding Quiz

## A quiz for the coding student 

This quiz tests the user on their knowledge of computer coding. The start screen is the initial page, but when the start button is clicked, the question and answer choices appear.

The user has 20 seconds to answer the question.  If they get it right, the next question appears. If they get it wrong, 5 seconds are subtracted from the time.  There's only 20 seconds, so if this affects the score, which is counted as the number of questions correctly answered. 

Once the quiz is completed or time runs out, the user is taken to the end page.  There, they can view their score and input their initials to save it to localStorage.  

The user is then immediately taken to the highscores page, which displays the scores.  This page is also accessible in the start page in the top left corner.
